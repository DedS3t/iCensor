# Important!
On the source code the slurs/swears have been ommited.
## Inspiration
As more and more people are using the internet more content gets released. This content may be offensive, mean, or just fake. The goal of iCensor is to make sure that you will be happy with the content that you see. 
## What it does
iCensor is a chrome extension that filters inappropriate content on the pages you see. It will automatically censor all slurs, swears, etc. You are also able to customize what it should censor. It also provides a blacklist that you can customize.
## How I built it
I used the chrome-api to be able to build chrome extensions. I then used html/css/js and interactions to the chrome-api to build the extension.
## Challenges I ran into
The largest challenge I ran into was making sure that the content on the page gets replaced without a noticeable delay. I eventually figured it out using regex.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of completing my first working chrome extension.  
## What I learned
I learned how a chrome extension works and how to utilize the chrome-api to make the extension interact with the user's DOM.
## What's next for iCensor
Currently iCensor censors inappropriate words/phrases, but in the future I would want iCensor to also be able to censor images/videos if they are found to be inappropriate.
